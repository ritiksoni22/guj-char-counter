# Gujarati Character Counter

A lightweight Gujarati character counter built for print, typography, and content estimation. It counts user-perceived characters (grapheme clusters) while applying Gujarati-specific rules around half letters, matras, and special signs.

## Use case

Use this app when you need reliable character counts for Gujarati content—such as designing layouts, fitting copy into fixed spaces, preparing print artwork, or quoting work based on character volume. It removes spaces, punctuation, and symbols, and treats combined characters in a way that matches how readers perceive them.
